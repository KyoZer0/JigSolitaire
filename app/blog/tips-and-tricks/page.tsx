                <p>
                    Whether you&apos;re a beginner looking to improve or an experienced puzzler aiming for
                    perfect scores, these strategies will help you master tile-swapping puzzles. From
                    fundamental techniques to advanced optimization, we&apos;ve applied insights from
                    cognitive science research to develop these evidence-based approaches.
                </p>

                <h2>Beginner Strategies</h2>

                <h3>1. Study the Preview First</h3>
                <p>
                    Before making any moves, take 30 seconds to really study the target image. Notice the
                    major color regions, distinctive features, and how the image is divided. Research on
                    expert performance by K. Anders Ericsson shows that deliberate, structured observation
                    is more effective than immediately jumping into action. This mental map will guide every
                    swap you make.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Start with Corners</h3>
                <p>
                    Corner tiles are the easiest to identify because they have two distinct edges. Place
                    all four corners first (on a rectangular grid) and you&apos;ll immediately have anchor
                    points for the rest of the puzzle. This strategy leverages the Gestalt principle of
                    boundary detection — our visual system processes edges and boundaries before interior details.
                </p>

                <h3>3. Work the Edges</h3>
                <p>
                    After the corners, focus on edge tiles. Edge pieces have one border side and are
                    easier to identify than interior tiles. Complete the border first and you&apos;ll have a
                    frame that makes the interior easier to solve. This &ldquo;frame-first&rdquo; approach reduces
                    cognitive load by eliminating variables.
                </p>

                <h2>Intermediate Techniques</h2>

                <h3>4. Use Color Blocking</h3>
                <p>
                    Group tiles by their dominant color. If the sky occupies the top third of the image,
                    find all blue-dominant tiles and move them to the top area. This &ldquo;rough sorting&rdquo;
                    dramatically reduces the number of possibilities for each position. Color is processed
                    pre-attentively by the visual system — research by Anne Treisman shows it takes as
                    little as 50 milliseconds to detect color differences.
                </p>

                <h3>5. Look for Continuation Lines</h3>
                <p>
                    Many images have lines, patterns, or textures that continue from one tile to the next.
                    A tree branch, a building edge, or a color gradient — these continuation lines are
                    your best clues for which tiles are adjacent. This exploits the Gestalt principle of
                    continuity: our brains naturally want to complete interrupted patterns.
                </p>

                <h3>6. Leverage the Merge System</h3>
                <p>
                    In tile-swapping games with merge mechanics, correctly placed adjacent tiles combine
                    into movable groups. Use this strategically: when you place a tile correctly next to
                    an already-correct tile, they&apos;ll merge. This reduces the number of individual
                    pieces you need to manage, lowering working memory demands.
                </p>

                <h2>Advanced Optimization</h2>

                <h3>7. Chain Swaps</h3>
                <p>
                    A chain swap is when tile A goes to position B, tile B goes to position C, and tile C
                    goes to position A. Instead of doing this in three swaps, plan the sequence so each
                    swap puts at least one tile in its final position. This is analogous to the concept
                    of &ldquo;cycle decomposition&rdquo; in permutation mathematics.
                </p>

                <h3>8. The Two-Pass Method</h3>
                <p>
                    On your first pass, focus only on tiles you&apos;re 100% confident about. Place the obvious
                    ones first. On your second pass, the remaining tiles become much easier to identify
                    because there are fewer options. This mirrors Daniel Kahneman&apos;s distinction between
                    System 1 (fast, intuitive) and System 2 (slow, analytical) thinking — use your
                    intuition first, then apply analysis.
                </p>

                <h3>9. Minimize Disruption</h3>
                <p>
                    Before swapping a tile into its correct position, check whether the tile currently in
                    that position is also close to its own correct spot. If so, you might be able to do
                    a single swap that benefits both tiles rather than disrupting one to fix another.
                </p>

                <h3>10. Time vs. Moves</h3>
                <p>
                    Decide your goal before starting: are you optimizing for speed or for minimum moves?
                    Speed requires quick pattern recognition and instinct. Minimum moves requires
                    careful planning and sometimes pausing to analyze the best sequence. Research on
                    speed-accuracy tradeoffs shows that these are genuinely different cognitive strategies
                    that benefit from deliberate practice.
                </p>

                <h2>Practice Makes Perfect</h2>
                <p>
                    The best way to improve is consistent, deliberate practice. Research by Ericsson et al.
                    (1993) on expert performance shows that improvement requires working at the edge of your
                    current ability. Start with easier grids and gradually increase difficulty. You&apos;ll
                    naturally develop the pattern recognition and spatial reasoning skills that make each
                    puzzle feel more intuitive over time.
